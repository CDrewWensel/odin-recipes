    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ina Garten’s Perfect Roast chicken is so moist and flavorful no wonder why people love this chicken so much! It’s seasoned with some fresh lemon, thyme, and garlic.  I never would have thought that just stuffing some aromatics like this inside a chicken would make a chicken taste so good.</p>
